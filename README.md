# Fitbit Python Scripts
These are the scripts I wrote during my summer shift (Freshman Summer 2018) as an undergraduate research assistant with the CSE department (Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering) at the University of Washington. 

I worked on two projects during my time there. Project 1 dealt with pulling data from Fitbits using the Fitbit API and tractdb, an open-source database. My role was to assist the professor I was working with, Professor James Fogarty, in finding relevant data that could be applied to the development of a migraine tracking app, the second project I worked on.

Project 2, as mentioned above, was a migraine tracking app. This project was the thesis for the PhD candidate I was working with, Jessica Schroeder. When I was first introduced to this project, it was in its early developmental stages. I personally conducted several pilot studies with participants who suffer from migraines and interviews with healthcare providers. Through this, I was able to gain a stronger understanding of what information is necessary to develop an app suitable for a wide range of audiences.  

These two projects are related in that I eventually used the data I obtained from Fitbits to help determine how to develop an app appropriate for the average user, based on sleep and activity data.
