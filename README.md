# Fitbit Python Scripts
Content for freshman undergraduate research in summer 2018. 

The first project includes Python scripts to pull data using the Fitbit API. 

The second project a migraine tracking app. I personally conducted several pilot studies with participants who suffer from migraines and interviews with healthcare providers. Through this, I was able to gain a stronger understanding of what information is necessary to develop an app suitable for a wide range of audiences.  

These two projects are related in that I eventually used the data I obtained from Fitbits to help determine how to develop an app appropriate for the average user, based on sleep and activity data.
